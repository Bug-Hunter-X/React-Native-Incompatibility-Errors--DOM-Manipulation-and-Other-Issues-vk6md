# React Native Incompatibility Errors

This repository demonstrates a common but difficult-to-diagnose error in React Native development: incompatibility with libraries not designed for the React Native environment.  Specifically, the example involves a library that relies on DOM manipulation, which is unavailable in React Native.

## Problem

Many JavaScript libraries are built for web browsers and heavily utilize the Document Object Model (DOM).  These libraries will likely fail when used within React Native, often producing cryptic error messages.  The `bug.js` file shows this scenario.

## Solution

The solution involves replacing the incompatible library with a React Native-compatible alternative or rewriting the problematic code to avoid DOM manipulation.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a possible solution.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install`.
4. Run `react-native run-android` or `react-native run-ios` (depending on your target platform).

## Lessons Learned

- Always check if a library is explicitly compatible with React Native before using it in your project.
- When dealing with cryptic errors, investigate library dependencies for potential conflicts.
- Consider alternatives or workarounds when a library relies heavily on functionalities unsupported in the React Native environment.
