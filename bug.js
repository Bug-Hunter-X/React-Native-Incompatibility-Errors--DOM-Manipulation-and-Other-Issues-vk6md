This error occurs when you are using a library that is not compatible with React Native's architecture.  This could be due to a dependency conflict, or the library simply not being designed to work within a React Native environment.  The error message may be vague, sometimes just indicating a general runtime failure or crash. 

Example Scenario: Using a library that relies heavily on DOM manipulation which React Native does not directly support.

```javascript
// buggy code
import { someDOMLibrary } from 'some-dom-library';

// ... React Native component using someDOMLibrary ...
```

Debugging this issue involves carefully checking your package dependencies for conflicts, verifying that third-party libraries are React Native compatible, and potentially looking at the library's source code to identify parts that may not be compatible with React Native's runtime environment.
