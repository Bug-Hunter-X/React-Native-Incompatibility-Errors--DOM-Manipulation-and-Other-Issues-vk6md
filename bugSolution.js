The solution involves replacing `someDOMLibrary` with a React Native compatible alternative, or rewriting the code to avoid DOM manipulation.  Here's a possible solution focusing on replacing the problematic functionality:

```javascript
// bugSolution.js
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';

// Replace someDOMLibrary with a React Native equivalent, or use React Native's built-in components
// For instance, if someDOMLibrary did styling, you might use StyleSheet
const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1, justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>
      <Text>This component avoids DOM manipulation</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

This demonstrates a fundamental difference in handling UI between web and React Native.  Direct DOM manipulation is not possible in React Native; instead, you work with React Native's component architecture.
